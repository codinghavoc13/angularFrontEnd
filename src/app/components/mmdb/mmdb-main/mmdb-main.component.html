<h1>MMDB - My Movie DataBase</h1>
<h2>UNDER CONSTRUCTION - Check back later for more</h2>
<p>Think of this as a drastically reduced, very basic version of IMDB. Instead of listing details about every movie,
    actor, director, etc, this will only list some basic information about movies that I own.</p>
    <p><b>NOTE:</b> Still looking into an issue where the wrong list of actors is showing up or no actors are showing up
    at all. Every movie has at least one actor paired with it and vice versa</p>
