    <!--student and parent versions will likely be the same: grades, grouped by course, with grade for that assignment
    Will probably use the accordion design, one tab for each assignment type, the tab will have:
        - the number of assignments assigned
        - the number that have been graded
        - the overall grade for that group of assignments (plan for now is homework/quiz/test = 30/30/40)
    Below the accordion will be the overall grade for the course as of when they are viewing it
    The big difference between the two views is that the student will only show that student's info, the parent will show all students;
        I'm thinking a separate component that takes a list of student info; the student will simply be a list of one-->
