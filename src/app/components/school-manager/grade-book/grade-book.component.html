<p>grade-book works!</p>
<!--Scrap the accordion plan, going with a split panel display
    - left panel is a list of filters: course name/block/period, assignment type, want to come up with a way to group due dates into blocks instead of storing all dates
    - right panel will display the following: student name - course - assignment - assignment due date - grade - edit/save button
        example: 'John Doe - Biology - Mid Term Quiz - 10 December 2024 - 95 - Edit/Save'
        Right panel will likely be a table format to keep each section the same width
        Edit/Save button text will default to Edit but will change to Save when the Teacher is trying to make a change-->
